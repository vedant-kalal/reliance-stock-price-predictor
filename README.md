📈 Reliance Stock Price Prediction (India)
This project focuses on predicting Reliance Industries Ltd. stock prices using machine learning models on historical data from the Indian stock market (NSE).

We analyze and visualize patterns in historical stock prices and build a predictive model that estimates future stock closing prices.


🧠 Project Goals
Understand Reliance stock price behavior using data analysis.

Visualize key stock metrics (Open, Close, Volume, VWAP, etc.).

Build and train a regression model using scikit-learn.

Predict stock prices based on real-time or user-given input features.


🗂️ Dataset
Historical Reliance stock data (past 1 year, CSV format)

Includes columns like:
Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, VWAP, LTP, 52W H, 52W L, etc.

📌 Source: NSE official site (manually downloaded)


📊 Features Used
Technical indicators:
Open, High, Low, Close, VWAP, Volume, etc.

Target: Close Price


🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

📬 Future Work
Add support for live prediction using real-time stock APIs (e.g., yfinance).

Integrate with Streamlit for an interactive web UI.

Try advanced models: XGBoost, LSTM (for time series).
